Forked version of [grimzy/laravel-mysql-spatial](https://github.com/grimzy/laravel-mysql-spatial) maintained by Open Southeners as it seems a little bit abandoned by its original author(s). All credits goes to them for creating it.

**Note: The Github project / repository has been modified to match organisation requirements.**

**To check all documentation and usage use the original repository (will be maintained until somehow need to change in functionality).**

## Notice

**This repository is unmaintained as we migrate our projects to use: [matanyadaev/laravel-eloquent-spatial](https://github.com/MatanYadaev/laravel-eloquent-spatial)**

## Getting started

The only procedure that changes is the package name under packagist, **you shall install this one** via the following command:

```sh
composer require open-southeners/laravel-mysql-spatial
```
